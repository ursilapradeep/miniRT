This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by spaipur and uvadakku.

MiniRT is a minimal ray‑tracing engine written in C. It loads a .rt scene file, parses objects and lights, and renders a simple 3D image using ray casting, intersection tests, and basic lighting.

Scene syntax (reference)

Ambient (A): A <ratio> <R,G,B> — ratio 0.0–1.0, color 0–255 per channel. One ambient allowed.
Camera (C): C <pos> <orient> <FOV> — orient must be normalized; one camera allowed.
Light (L): L <pos> <brightness> <R,G,B> — brightness 0.0–1.0.
Sphere (sp): sp <center> <diameter> <R,G,B>
Plane (pl): pl <point> <normal> <R,G,B> — normal should be normalized.
Cylinder (cy): cy <center> <orientation> <diameter> <height> <R,G,B>

Each element has a fixed format: vectors, colors, ratios, and sizes.

Minimal .rt example

A 0.2 255,255,255
C 0,0,0 0,0,1 70

sp 0,0,20 5 255,0,0

Build and run a sample scene:

cd miniRT

Build

Linux (X11) or macOS

Clean

make clean
make fclean



General rules

Values are separated by spaces. Vectors use x,y,z notation.
Colors use R,G,B with integer values 0–255.
Lines starting with # are comments (useful for annotations).

Mathematical concepts

Vector operations

MiniRT relies heavily on basic vector math because rays, normals, and directions are all vectors.

    Add/subtract — used to compute directions (e.g., light − hit point), move points, and build rays.
    Dot product — measures how aligned two vectors are; essential for diffuse lighting (Lambert’s law).
    Cross product — used to build camera orientation (right/up vectors) and ensure orthogonality.

Normalization — converts a vector to length 1; required for stable lighting and ray direction calculations.

These operations form the mathematical backbone of ray tracing.

Ray–object intersection tests:

MiniRT computes where a ray hits an object using analytic formulas.

    Ray–sphere — solve a quadratic equation to find where the ray meets the sphere surface.
    Ray–plane — solve a linear equation using dot products; simplest intersection.
    Ray–cylinder — more complex; involves projecting the ray onto the cylinder axis and solving a quadratic.

These tests determine the closest visible object for each pixel.

Projection geometry and camera rays

MiniRT uses a simple pinhole camera model:

    The camera has a position, orientation, and FOV.
    For each pixel, MiniRT computes a ray direction by projecting the pixel into 3D space using the camera’s basis vectors (forward, right, up).
    This creates a ray that travels from the camera through the pixel into the scene.

This is how the 2D image becomes a 3D view.

Lighting model

MiniRT implements a basic but effective lighting pipeline:

    Ambient — constant base light so objects aren’t completely black.
    Diffuse (Lambert) — depends on angle between light direction and surface normal; gives soft shading.
    Specular — simple highlight based on reflection direction; adds shine to surfaces.


Shadow rays (hard shadows)

To determine if a point is lit:

    MiniRT sends a shadow ray from the hit point toward the light.
    If the ray hits another object before reaching the light, the point is in shadow.
    This produces hard shadows (no soft edges).

Shadow rays add depth and realism to the scene.
